-- Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't 
-- want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order 
-- by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) 
-- assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower 
-- than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one 
-- student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
